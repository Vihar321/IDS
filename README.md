# AI-Powered Intrusion Detection System (IDS)

This is my first project combining **Cybersecurity + AI**.  
The system uses a machine learning model to classify network traffic into *normal* or *attack* patterns.  

## Features
- Built in Python on Kali Linux
- Uses machine learning (Random Forest)
- Works on the NSL-KDD dataset

## Next Steps
- Improve preprocessing
- Try deep learning models
- Add real-time packet capture

## How to Run
```bash
python3 ids.py
